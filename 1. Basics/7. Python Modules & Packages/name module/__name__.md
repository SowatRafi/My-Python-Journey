**Python name attribute**

* Every module in Python has a special variable called `name`

* The value of the name attribute is set to `main` when the module is executed as the main program.

* The value of the name can be set to another module if imported or module it is called from.

* The `if` statement prevents certain code within the block being executed.

* The `if__name__=="__main__"` allows you to run Python files as reusable modules or standalone programs.
